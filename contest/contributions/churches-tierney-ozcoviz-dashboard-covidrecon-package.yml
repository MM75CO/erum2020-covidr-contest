title: "OzCoViz Dashboard and the covidrecon Package"
author: Tim Churches (UNSW), Nicholas Tierney (Monash University)
abstract: |
  OzCoViz is yet another COVID-19 dashboard which nonetheless seeks to go beyond
  the now ubiquitous world maps and cumulative incidence charts to offer a range
  of principled epidemiological and statistical analyses, as well as some novel
  visualisations, including animations. The dashboard leverages the associated
  covidrecon package which encapsulates much of the data processing required by
  the dashboard, thus making the dashboard code dramatically simpler and easier
  to extend. The site has been created by researchers at Australian
  universities, and hence the focus is on the situation in Australia, within
  the broader international context, but the site should be easy to adapt for
  use by other countries.
